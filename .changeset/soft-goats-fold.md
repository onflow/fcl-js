Added `ScheduledTransactionList` component, a scrollable list that displays scheduled transactions for a Flow account with support for MetadataViews.Display (thumbnails, names, descriptions), transaction cancellation, automatic refresh, responsive design and dark mode. Each card shows the scheduled execution time, fee, priority, and effort with an optional cancel button for pending transactions.
