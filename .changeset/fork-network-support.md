Add support for fork networks (mainnet-fork, testnet-fork) to enable testing against forked emulator with automatic contract alias inheritance from parent networks. Fork networks allow developers to run their dapps and E2E tests against a local emulator that mirrors mainnet or testnet state, while supporting contract-specific overrides.
