- **Risk of Breaking Change:** Low
- **Compatibility:** `>= @onflow/fcl@0.0.71`

# Overview and Introduction

**Personally sign data via FCL Compatible Wallets**

**FCL** now incldues **`signUserMessage()`** which allows for the sending of unencrypted message data to a connected wallet provider or service to be signed with a user's private key. 

An application or service can verify a signature against a user's public key on the **Flow Blockchain**, providing proof a user controls the account's private key.   

**Use Cases**

- **Authentication**: Cryptographically verify the ownership of a **Flow** account by signing a piece of data using a private key
- **Improved Application Login**
  - **Increased security**: Arguably more secure than proof of ownership by email/password
  - **Simplified UX**: No application password required
  - **Increased privacy**: No email or third party authentication service needed
- **Message Validation**: Assuring that a message sent or received has not been tampered with
- **Multisig contracts**
- **Decentralised exchanges**
- **Meta transactions**


# Config and Authentication

As a prerequisite, **FCL** is configured to point to the Wallet Provider's Authentication Endpoint. No additional configuration is required.

> During development (and on mainnet) FCL can be configured to use the wallet directly by
> setting the **Wallet Discovery Url** to the wallet provider's **Authentication Endpoint**
> by configuring fcl like this `config().put("discovery.wallet", "https://my-awesome-wallet-provider.com/fcl/authenticate")`.

Common Configuration Keys and additional info can be found here [How to Configure FCL](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/blob/master/docs/configure-fcl.mdx#common-configuration-keys)

1. A user initiates authentication with the wallet provider via application UI
2. The wallet confirms a user's identity and sends back information used to configure **FCL** for future user actions in the application
3. Included in the authentication response should be the provider's [Key Services](#) including a **`user-signature`** service for use with **`signUserMessage()`**

# User Signature Service

A [user-signature service](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/blob/master/packages/fcl/src/current-user/normalize/user-signature.js#L4-L14) is a standard service, with methods for **IFRAME/RPC** or **HTTP/POST**.

The `user-signature` service receives a signable message from **FCL** and returns a standard [PollingResponse](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/blob/8e53ac59636e28cdcfa2494de6cb278e71bc14c2/packages/fcl/src/current-user/normalize/polling-response.js#L5) with an array of [CompositeSignatures](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/blob/8e53ac59636e28cdcfa2494de6cb278e71bc14c2/packages/fcl/src/current-user/normalize/composite-signature.js#L4) or `null` as the data.

A status of **Approved** needs to have an array of composite signatures as data. 

A status of **Declined** needs to include a reason why. 

A **Pending** status needs to include an updates service and can include a local. 
A service using the **`IFRAME/RPC`** method can only respond with approved or declined, as pending is not valid for iframes.


When `signUserMessage()` is called by the application, **FCL** uses the service method to decide how to send the signable to the wallet.

The Wallet is responsible for prepending the signable with the correct `UserDomainTag`, hashing, and signing the message.

# Signing Sequence

1. Application sends message to signing service. **FCL expects a hexadecimal string**
3. Wallet/Service tags the message with required `UserDomainTag` (see below), hashes, and signs using the `signatureAlgorithm` specified on account key
2. Wallet makes available a Composite Signature consisting of `addr`, `keyId`, and `signature` **as a hex string**

### UserDomainTag
The **`UserDomainTag`** is the prefix of all signed user space payloads.

Before hashing and signing the message, the wallet must add a specified DOMAIN TAG.

> currently **"FLOW-V0.0-user"**

A domain tag is encoded as **UTF-8 bytes, right padded to a total length of 32 bytes**, prepended to the message.

Using upcoming functionalty of **FCL**, the signature can now be verified on the Flow blockchain. The following illustrates an example.

```javascript
// this code example was done before compSig was an array of composite signatures.
// An uptodate version will be updated here ASAP

function validateSignedUserMessage(message, compSig) {
  return fcl.query({
    cadence: `
        import Crypto
        pub fun main(message: String, addr: Address, keyId: Int, signature: String): Bool {
          let acct = getAccount(addr)
          let key = acct.keys.get(keyIndex: keyId)
          let publicKey = PublicKey(
            publicKey: key.publicKey,
            signatureAlgorithm: key.signatureAlgorithm,
          )
          return publicKey.verify(
            signature: signature.decodeHex(),
            signedData: message.decodeHex(),
            domainSeparationTag: "FLOW-V0.0-user",
            hashAlgorithm: key.hashAlgorithm,
          )
        }
      `,
    args: (arg, t) => [
      arg(message, t.String),
      arg(compSig.addr, t.Address),
      arg(compSig.keyId, t.Int),
      arg(compSig.signature, t.String),
    ],
  })
}
```

# TL;DR Wallet Provider

- Register with **FCL** and provide signing service endpoint. No further configuration is needed.
- On receipt of message, prompt user to approve or decline
- Prepend `UserDomainTag`, hash and sign the message with the signatureAlgorithm specified on user's key
- Return a standard `PollingResponse` with an array of `CompositeSignatures` as data or `null` and `reason` if declined
