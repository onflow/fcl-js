# FCL: Flow Client Library
### Making secure web applications powered by the Flow Blockchain

Flow Client Library (FCL) enables applications to easily integrate with all FCL-compatible wallets and
other services (e.g. (Comming Soon) profiles, private information, notifications). This offers developers a strong
foundation to compose their apps with existing building blocks. Itâ€™s currently supported for browser
applications, and will be extended to other platforms.

With FCL, you can:

- Integrate all compatible wallets without any custom code or code injection
- Authenticate users
- Query the Flow Blockchain
- Send transactions (e.g. initializing resources, sending assets, purchasing, etc.)
- Sign transactions through wallet integration avoiding key management

With FCL, you will eventually be able to:

- Personally sign data via FCL Compatible Wallets
- Request Additional User info like Emails
