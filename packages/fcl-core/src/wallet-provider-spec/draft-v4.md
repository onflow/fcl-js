# Overview

Flow Client Library (FCL) approaches the idea of blockchain wallets on Flow in a different way than how wallets may be supported on other blockchains. For example, with FCL, a wallet is not necessarily limited to being a browser extension or even a native application on a users device. FCL offers wallet developers the flexibility and freedom to build many different types of applications. Since wallet applications can take on many forms, we needed to create a way for these varying applications to be able to communicate and work together.

FCL acts in many ways as a protocol to facilitate communication and configuration between the different parties involved in a blockchain application. An _Application_ can use FCL to _authenticate_ users, and request _authorizations_ for transactions, as well as mutate and query the _Blockchain_. An application using FCL offers its _Users_ a way to connect and select any number of Wallet Providers and their Wallet Services. A selected _Wallet_ provides an Application's instance of FCL with configuration information about itself and its Wallet Services, allowing the _User_ and _Application_ to interact with them.

In the following paragraphs we'll explore ways in which you can integrate with FCL by providing implementations of various FCL services.

The following services will be covered:

- Authentication (Authn) Service
- Authorization (Authz) Service
- User Signature Service
- Pre-Authz Service

# Service Methods

FCL Services are your way as a Wallet Provider of configuring FCL with information about what your wallet can do. FCL uses what it calls `Service Methods` to perform your supported FCL services. Service Methods are the ways FCL can talk to your wallet. Your wallet gets to decide which of these service methods each of your supported services use to communicate with you.

Sometimes services just configure FCL and that's it. An example of this can be seen with the Authentication Service and the OpenID Service.
With those two services you are simply telling FCL "here is a bunch of info about the current user". (You will see that those two services both have a `method: "DATA"` field in them.
Currently these are the only two cases that can be a data service.)

Other services can be a little more complex. For example, they might require a back and forth communication between FCL and the Service in question.
Ultimately we want to do this back and forth via a secure back-channel (https requests to servers), **but in some situations that isn't a viable option, so there is also a front-channel option**.
Where possible, you should aim to provide a back-channel support for services, and only fall back to a front-channel if absolutely necessary.

Back-channel communications use `method: "HTTP/POST"`, while front-channel communications use `method: "IFRAME/RPC"`, `method: "POP/RPC"`, `method: "TAB/RPC` and `method: "EXT/RPC"`.

| Service Method | Front  |  Back |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| HTTP/POST      |   ⛔   |   ✅   |
| IFRAME/RPC     |   ✅   |   ⛔   |
| POP/RPC        |   ✅   |   ⛔   |
| TAB/RPC        |   ✅   |   ⛔   |
| EXT/RPC        |   ✅   |   ⛔   |

It's important to note that regardless of the method of communication, the data that is sent back and forth between the parties involved is the same.

# Protocol schema definitions
In this section we define the schema of objects used in the protocol. While they are JavaScript objects, only features supported by JSON should be used. (Meaning that conversion of an object to and from JSON should not result in any loss.)

For the schema definition language we choose TypeScript, so that the schema closely resembles the actual type definitions one would use when making an FCL implementation.

**Note that currently there are no official type definitions available for FCL. If you are using TypeScript, you will have to create your own type definitions (possibly based on the schema definitions presented in this document).**

## Common definitions
In this section we introduce some common definitions that the individual object definitions will be deriving from.

First, let us define the kinds of FCL objects available:
```typescript
type ObjectType =
  | 'PollingResponse'
  | 'Service'
  | 'Identity'
  | 'ServiceProvider'
  | 'AuthnResponse'
  | 'Signable'
  | 'CompositeSignature'
  | 'OpenID'
```

The fields common to all FCL objects then can be defined as follows:
```typescript
interface ObjectBase<Version = '1.0.0'> {
  f_vsn: Version
  f_type: ObjectType
}
```

The `f_vsn` field is usually `1.0.0` for this specification, but some exceptions will be defined by passing a different `Version` type parameter to `ObjectBase`.

All FCL objects carry an `f_type` field so that their types can be identified at runtime.

## FCL objects
In this section we will define the FCL objects with each `ObjectType`.

We also define the union of them to mean any FCL object:
```typescript
type FclObject =
  | PollingResponse
  | Service
  | Identity
  | ServiceProvider
  | AuthnResponse
  | Signable
  | CompositeSignature
  | OpenID
```

### `PollingResponse`

```typescript
interface PollingResponse extends ObjectBase {
  f_type: 'PollingResponse'
  status: 'APPROVED' | 'DECLINED' | 'PENDING' | 'REDIRECT'
  reason: string | null
  data?: FclObject
  updates?: FclObject
  local?: FclObject
}
```

Each response back to FCL must be "wrapped" in a `PollingResponse`. The `status` field determines the meaning of the response:
- An `APPROVED` status means that the request has been approved. The `data` field should be present.
- A `DECLINED` status means that the request has been declined. The `reason` field should contain a human readable reason for the refusal.
- A `PENDING` status means that the request is being processed. More `PENDING` responses may follow, but eventually a non-pending status should be returned. The `updates` and `local` fields may be present.
- The `REDIRECT` status is reserved, and should not be used by wallet services.

In summary, zero or more `PENDING` responses should be followed by a non-pending response. It is entirely acceptable for your service to immediately return an `APPROVED` Polling Response, skipping a `PENDING` state.

See also [PollingResponse](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/blob/master/packages/fcl/src/current-user/normalize/polling-response.js).

Here are some examples of valid `PollingResponse` objects:
```javascript
// APPROVED
{
  f_type: "PollingResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  status: "APPROVED",
  data: ___, // what the service needs to send to FCL
}

// Declined
{
  f_type: "PollingResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  status: "DECLINED",
  reason: "Declined by user."
}

// Pending - Simple
{
  f_type: "PollingResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  status: "PENDING",
  updates: {
    f_type: "Service",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    type: "back-channel-rpc",
    endpoint: "https://____", // where post request will be sent
    method: "HTTP/POST",
    data: {},   // will be included in the request's body
    params: {}, // will be included in the request's url
  }
}

// Pending - First Time with Local
{
  f_type: "PollingResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  status: "PENDING",
  updates: {
    f_type: "Service",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    type: "back-channel-rpc",
    endpoint: "https://____", // where post request will be sent
    method: "HTTP/POST",
    data: {},   // included in body of request
    params: {}, // included as query params on endpoint
  },
  local: {
    f_type: "Service",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    endpoint: "https://____", // the iframe that will be rendered,
    method: "VIEW/IFRAME",
    data: {}, // sent to frame when ready
    params: {}, // included as query params on endpoint
  }
}
```

A `PollingResponse` can alternatively be constructed using `WalletUtils` when sending `"APPROVED"` or `"DECLINED"` responses.

```javascript
import {WalletUtils} from "@onflow/fcl"

// Approving a PollingResponse
// Example using an AuthnResponse as the PollingResponse data
WalletUtils.approve({
  f_type: "AuthnResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0"
  ...
})

// Rejecting a PollingResponse
// Supplies a reason for declining
const reason = "User declined to authenticate."
WalletUtils.decline(reason)
```

### `Service`

```typescript
type ServiceType =
  | 'authn'
  | 'authz'
  | 'user-signature'
  | 'pre-authz'
  | 'open-id'
  | 'back-channel-rpc'
  | 'authn-refresh'

type ServiceMethod =
  | 'HTTP/POST'
  | 'IFRAME/RPC'
  | 'POP/RPC'
  | 'TAB/RPC'
  | 'EXT/RPC'
  | 'DATA'

interface Service extends ObjectBase {
  f_type: 'Service'
  type: ServiceType
  method: ServiceMethod
  uid: string
  endpoint: string
  id: string
  identity: Identity
  provider?: ServiceProvider
  data?: FclObject
}
```

The meaning of the fields is as follows.
- `type`: The type of this service.
- `method`: The service method this service uses. `DATA` means that the purpose of this service is just to provide the information in this `Service` object, and no active communication services are provided.
- `uid`: A unique identifier for the service. A common scheme for deriving this is to use `'wallet-name#${type}'`, where `${type}` refers to the type of this service.
- `endpoint`: Defines where to communicate with the service.
  - When `method` is `EXT/RPC`, this can be an arbitrary unique string, and the extension will need to use it to identify its own services. A common scheme for deriving the `endpoint` is to use `'ext:${address}'`, where `${address}` refers to the wallet's address. (See `ServiceProvider` for more information.)
- `id`: The wallet's internal identifier for the user. If no other identifier is used, simply the user's flow account address can be used here.
- `identity`: Information about the identity of the user.
- `provider`: Information about the wallet.
- `data`: Additional information used with a service of type `open-id`.

### `Identity`
This object is used to define the identity of the user.

```typescript
interface Identity extends ObjectBase {
  f_type: 'Identity'
  address: string
  keyId?: number
}
```

The meaning of the fields is as follows.
- `address`: The flow account address of the user.
- `keyId`: The id of the key associated with this account that will be used for signing.

### `ServiceProvider`
This object is used to communicate information about a wallet.

```typescript
interface ServiceProvider extends ObjectBase {
  f_type: 'ServiceProvider'
  address: string
  name?: string
  description?: string
  icon?: string
  website?: string
  supportUrl?: string
  supportEmail?: string
}
```

The meaning of the fields is as follows.
- `address`: A flow account address owned by the wallet. It is unspecified what this will be used for.
- `name`: The name of the wallet.
- `description`: A short description for the wallet.
- `icon`: An image URL for the wallet's icon.
- `website`: The wallet's website.
- `supportUrl`: A URL the user can use to get support with the wallet.
- `supportEmail`: An e-mail address the user can use to get support with the wallet.

### `AuthnResponse`
This object is used to inform FCL about the services a wallet provides.

```typescript
interface AuthnResponse extends ObjectBase {
  f_type: 'AuthnResponse'
  addr: string
  services: Service[]
}
```

The meaning of the fields is as follows.
- `addr`: The flow account address of the user.
- `services`: The list of services provided by the wallet.

### `Signable`

```typescript
interface Signable extends ObjectBase<'1.0.1'> {
  f_type: 'Signable'
  addr: string
  keyId: number
  voucher: {
    cadence: string
    refBlock: string
    computeLimit: number
    arguments: {
      type: string
      value: unknown
    }[]
    proposalKey: {
      address: string
      keyId: number
      sequenceNum: number
    }
    payer: string
    authorizers: string[]
  }
}
```

The `WalletUtils.encodeMessageFromSignable` function can be used to calculate the message that needs to be signed.

### `CompositeSignature`

```typescript
interface CompositeSignature extends ObjectBase {
  f_type: 'CompositeSignature'
  addr: string
  keyId: number
  signature: string
}
```

See also [CompositeSignature](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/blob/master/packages/fcl/src/current-user/normalize/composite-signature.js).

### `OpenID`
TODO

## Miscellaneous objects

### `Message`
```typescript
type MessageType =
  | 'FCL:VIEW:READY'
  | 'FCL:VIEW:READY:RESPONSE'
  | 'FCL:VIEW:RESPONSE'
  | 'FCL:VIEW:CLOSE'

type Message = {
  type: MessageType
}
```

A message that indicates the status of the protocol invocation.

This type is sometimes used as part of an _intersection type_. For example, the type `Message & PollingResponse` means a `PollingResponse` extended with the `type` field from `Message`.

### `ExtensionServiceInitiationMessage`
```typescript
type ExtensionServiceInitiationMessage = {
  service: Service
}
```

This object is used to invoke a service when the `EXT/RPC` service method is used.

# Service Methods

## IFRAME/RPC (Front Channel)

`IFRAME/RPC` is the easiest to explain, so we will start with it:

- An iframe is rendered (comes from the `endpoint` in the service).
- The rendered iframe adds a listener and sends the `"FCL:VIEW:READY"` message. This can be simplified `WalletUtils.ready(callback)`
- FCL will send the data to be dealt with:
  - Where `body` is the stuff you care about, `params` and `data` are additional information you can provide in the service object.
- The wallet sends back an `"APPROVED"` or `"DECLINED"` post message. (It will be a `f_type: "PollingResponse"`, which we will get to in a bit). This can be simplified using `WalletUtils.approve` and `WalletUtils.decline`
  - If it's approved, the polling response's data field will need to be what FCL is expecting.
  - If it's declined, the polling response's reason field should say why it was declined.

```javascript
export const WalletUtils.approve = data => {
  sendMsgToFCL("FCL:VIEW:RESPONSE", {
    f_type: "PollingResponse",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    status: "APPROVED",
    reason: null,
    data: data,
  })
}

export const WalletUtils.decline = reason => {
  sendMsgToFCL("FCL:VIEW:RESPONSE", {
    f_type: "PollingResponse",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    status: "DECLINED",
    reason: reason,
    data: null,
  })
}
```

## POP/RPC | TAB/RPC (Front Channel)

`POP/RPC` and `TAB/RPC` work in an almost entirely similar way to `IFRAME/RPC`, except instead of rendering the `method` in an iframe, we render it in a popup or new tab. The same communication protocol between the rendered view and FCL applies.

![POP/RPC Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/master/packages/fcl/assets/service-method-diagrams/pop-rpc.png)

![TAB/RPC Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/master/packages/fcl/assets/service-method-diagrams/tab-rpc.png)

## HTTP/POST (Back Channel)

`HTTP/POST` initially sends a post request to the `endpoint` specified in the service, which should immediately return a `f_type: "PollingResponse"`.

Like `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC` or `TAB/RPC`, our goal is to eventually get an `APPROVED` or `DECLINED` polling response, and technically this endpoint could return one of those immediately.

But more than likely that isn't the case and it will be in a `PENDING` state (`PENDING` is not available to `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC` or `TAB/RPC`).
When the polling response is `PENDING` it requires an `updates` field that includes a service, `BackChannelRpc`, that FCL can use to request an updated `PollingResponse` from.
FCL will use that `BackChannelRpc` to request a new `PollingResponse` which itself can be `APPROVED`, `DECLINED` or `PENDING`.
If it is `APPROVED` FCL will return, otherwise if it is `DECLINED` FCL will error. However, if it is `PENDING`, it will use the `BackChannelRpc` supplied in the new `PollingResponse` updates field. It will repeat this cycle until it is either `APPROVED` or `DECLINED`.

There is an additional optional feature that `HTTP/POST` enables in the first `PollingResponse` that is returned.
This optional feature is the ability for FCL to render an iframe, popup or new tab, and it can be triggered by supplying a service `type: "VIEW/IFRAME"`, `type: "VIEW/POP"` or `type: "VIEW/TAB"` and the `endpoint` that the wallet wishes to render in the `local` field of the `PollingResponse`. This is a great way for a wallet provider to switch to a webpage if displaying a UI is necessary for the service it is performing.

![HTTP/POST Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/master/packages/fcl/assets/service-method-diagrams/http-post.png)

## EXT/RPC (Front Channel)

`EXT/RPC` is used to enable and communicate between FCL and an installed web browser extension. (Though this specification is geared towards Chromium based browsers, it should be implementable in any browser with similar extension APIs available. From now on we will be using the word _Chrome_ to refer to Chromium based browsers.)

An implementation of `EXT/RPC` needs to somehow enable communication between the application and the extension context. Implementing this is a bit more complex and usually relies on 3 key scripts to allow message passing between an installed extension and FCL. The separation of contexts enforced by Chrome and the availability of different Chrome APIs within those contexts require these scripts to be set up in a particular sequence so that the communication channels needed by FCL's `EXT/RPC` service method will work.

The following is an overview of these scripts and the functionality they need to support FCL:

- `background.js`: Used to launch the extension popup with `chrome.windows.create` if selected by the user from Discovery or set directly via `fcl.config.discovery.wallet`
- `content.js`: Used to proxy messages between the application to the extension via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.
- `script.js`: Injected by `content.js` into the application's HTML page. It appends the extension authn service to the `window.fcl_extensions` array on page load. This allows FCL to confirm installation and send extension details to Discovery or launch your wallet as the default wallet.

An example and guide showing how to build an FCL compatible wallet extension on Flow can be found [here](https://github.com/onflow/wallet-extension-example).

Once the extension is enabled (for example when the user selects it through the discovery service), the following communication protocol applies. (The term _send_ should specifically refer to using `window.postMessage` in the application context, as this is the only interface between the application and the extension. Note that since `window.postMessage` broadcasts messages to all message event handlers, care should be taken by each party to filter only the messages targeted at them.)

- An `ExtensionServiceInitiationMessage` object is sent by FCL. It is the extension's responsibility to inspect the `endpoint` field of the service, and only activate itself (e.g. by opening a popup) if it is the provider of this service.
- The extension should respond by sending a `Message` with type `FCL:VIEW:READY`. (Usually this message will originate from the extension popup, and be relayed to the application context.)
- FCL will send a `Message` with type `FCL:VIEW:READY:RESPONSE`. Additional fields specific to the service (such as `body`, `params` or `data`) are usually present. See the section on the specific service for a description of these fields.
- The wallet sends back a `Message & PollingResponse` with type `FCL:VIEW:RESPONSE` with either an `APPROVED` or `DECLINED` status.
  - If it's approved, the polling response's data field will need to be what FCL is expecting.
  - If it's declined, the polling response's reason field should say why it was declined.

The extension can send a `Message` with type `FCL:VIEW:CLOSE` at any point during this protocol to indicate an interruption. This will halt FCL's current routine. On the other hand, once a `PollingResponse` with either an `APPROVED` or `DECLINED` status was sent, the protocol is considered finished, and the extension should not send any further messages as part of this exchange.

Conversely, when FCL sends a new `ExtensionServiceInitiationMessage`, the previous routine is interrupted. (This is the case even when the new service invocation is targeted at a different extension.)

Note that as a consequence of the above restrictions, only single service invocation can be in progress at a time.

Here is a code example for how an extension popup might send its response:
```javascript
  chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, {
    f_type: "PollingResponse",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    status: "APPROVED",
    reason: null,
    data: {
      f_type: "AuthnResponse",
      f_vsn: "1.0.0",
      addr: address,
      services: services,
    },
  });
```

![EXT/RPC Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/master/packages/fcl/assets/service-method-diagrams/ext-rpc.png)

## `data` and `params`

`data` and `params` are information that the wallet can provide in the service config that FCL will pass back to the service.
- `params` will be added onto the `endpoint` as query params.
- `data` will be included in the body of the `HTTP/POST` request or in the `FCL:VIEW:READY:RESPONSE` for a `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC`, `TAB/RPC` or `EXT/RPC`.

# Authentication Service

In the following examples, we'll walk you through the process of building an authentication service.

In FCL, wallets are configured by passing in a wallet provider's authentication URL or extension endpoint as the `discovery.wallet` config variable.

You will need to make and expose a webpage or API hosted at an authentication endpoint that FCL will use.

```javascript
// IN APPLICATION
// configuring fcl to point at a wallet looks like this
import {config} from "@onflow/fcl"

config({
  "discovery.wallet": "url-or-endpoint-fcl-will-use-for-authentication", // FCL Discovery endpoint, wallet provider's authentication URL or extension endpoint
  "discovery.wallet.method": "IFRAME/RPC" // Optional. Available methods are "IFRAME/RPC", "POP/RPC", "TAB/RPC", "EXT/RPC" or "HTTP/POST", defaults to "IFRAME/RPC".
})
```

If the method specified is `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC` or `TAB/RPC`, then the URL specified as `discovery.wallet` will be rendered as a webpage. If the configured method is `EXT/RPC`, `discovery.wallet` should be set to the extension's `authn` `endpoint`. Otherwise, if the method specified is `HTTP/POST`, then the authentication process will happen over HTTP requests. (While authentication can be accomplished using any of those service methods, this example will use the `IFRAME/RPC` service method.)

Once the Authentication webpage is rendered, the extension popup is enabled, or the API is ready, you then need to tell FCL that it is ready. You will do this by sending a message to FCL, and FCL will send back a message with some additional information that you can use about the application requesting authentication on behalf of the user.

The following example is using the `IFRAME/RPC` method. Your authentication webpage will likely resemble the following code:

```javascript
// IN WALLET AUTHENTICATION FRAME
import {WalletUtils} from "@onflow/fcl"

function callback(data) {
  if (typeof data != "object") return
  if (data.type !== "FCL:VIEW:READY:RESPONSE") return

  ... // Do authentication things ...

  // Send back AuthnResponse
  WalletUtils.sendMsgToFCL("FCL:VIEW:RESPONSE", {
    f_type: "PollingResponse",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    status: "APPROVED",
    data: {
      f_type: "AuthnResponse",
      f_vsn: "1.0.0"
      ...
    }
  })

  // Alternatively be sent using WalletUtils.approve (or WalletUtils.decline)
  // which will wrap AuthnResponse in a PollingResponse
  WalletUtils.approve({
    f_type: "AuthnResponse",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0"
    ...
  })
}
// add event listener first
WalletUtils.onMsgFromFCL("FCL:VIEW:READY:RESPONSE", callback)

// tell fcl the wallet is ready
WalletUtils.sendMsgToFCL("FCL:VIEW:READY")

// alternatively adds "FCL:VIEW:READY:RESPONSE" listener and sends "FCL:VIEW:READY"
WalletUtils.ready(callback)
```

During authentication, the application has a chance to request to you what they would like you to send back to them. These requests are included in the `FCL:VIEW:READY:RESPONSE` message sent to the wallet from FCL.

An example of such a request is the OpenID service. The application can request for example that you to send them the email address of the current user. The application requesting this information does not mean you need to send it. It's entirely optional for you to do so. However, some applications may depend on you sending the requested information back, and should you decline to do so it may cause the application to not work.

In the config they can also tell you a variety of things about them, such as the name of their application or a url for an icon of their application. You can use these pieces of information to customize your wallet's user experience should you desire to do so.

Your wallet having a visual distinction from the application, but still a seamless and connected experience is our goal here.

Whether your authentication process happens using a webpage with the `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC` or `TAB/RPC` methods, via an enabled extension using the `EXT/RPC` method, or using a backchannel to an API with the `HTTP/POST` method, the handshake is the same. The same messages are sent in all methods, however the transport mechanism changes. For `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC`, `TAB/RPC` or `EXT/RPC` methods, the transport is `window.postMessage()`, with the `HTTP/POST` method, the transport is HTTP post messages.

As always, you must never trust anything you receive from an application. Always do your due-diligence and be alert as you are the user's first line of defense against potentially malicious applications.

### Authenticate your User

It's important that you are confident that the user is who the user claims to be.

Have them provide enough proof to you that you are okay with passing their details back to FCL.
Using Blocto as an example, an authentication code is sent to the email a user enters at login.
This code can be used as validation and is everything Blocto needs to be confident in the user's identity.

### Once you know who your User is

Once you're confident in the user's identity, we can complete the authentication process.

The authentication process is complete once FCL receives back a response that configures FCL with FCL Services for the current user. This response is extremely important to FCL. At its core it tells FCL who the user is, and then via the included services it tells FCL how the user authenticated, how to request transaction signatures, how to get a personal message signed and the user's email and other details if requested. In the future it may also include many more things!

You can kind of think of FCL as a plugin system. But since those plugins exist elsewhere outside of FCL, FCL needs to be configured with information on how to communicate with them.

What you are sending back to FCL is everything that it needs to communicate with the plugins that you are supplying.
Your wallet is like a plugin to FCL, and these details tell FCL how to use you as a plugin.

Here is an example of an authentication response:

```javascript
// IN WALLET AUTHENTICATION FRAME
import {WalletUtils} from "@onflow/fcl"

WalletUtils.approve({
  f_type: "AuthnResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  addr: "0xUSER",                      // The user's flow address

  services: [                          // All the stuff that configures FCL

      // Authentication Service - REQUIRED
      {
          f_type: "Service",                                         // It's a service!
          f_vsn: "1.0.0",                                            // Follows the v1.0.0 spec for the service
          type: "authn",                                             // the type of service it is
          method: "DATA",                                            // It's data!
          uid: "amazing-wallet#authn",                               // A unique identifier for the service

          },
          // The Wallet's Info
          provider: {
              f_type: "ServiceProvider",      // It's a Service Provider
              f_vsn: "1.0.0",                 // Follows the v1.0.0 spec for service providers
              address: "0xWallet",            // A flow address owned by the wallet
              name: "Amazing Wallet",         // OPTIONAL - The name of your wallet. ie: "Dapper Wallet" or "Blocto Wallet"

          },
      },

      },

      // User Signature Service

              f_type: "OpenID",
              f_vsn: "1.0.0",
              profile: {
                  name: "Jeff",
                  family_name: "D", // icky underscored names because of OpenID Connect spec
                  given_name: "Jeffrey",
                  middle_name: "FakeMiddleName",
                  nickname: "JeffJeff",
                  preferred_username: "Jeff",

              }
          },
      }
  ]
})
```

### Stopping an Authentication Process

From any frame, you can send a `FCL:VIEW:CLOSE` post message to FCL, which will halt FCL's current routine and close the frame.

```javascript
import {WalletUtils} from "@onflow/fcl"

WalletUtils.sendMsgToFCL("FCL:VIEW:CLOSE")
```

# Authorization Service

Authorization services are depicted with with a `type: "authz"`, and a `method` of either `HTTP/POST`, `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC`, `TAB/RPC` or `EXT/RPC`.
They are expected to eventually return a `f_type: "CompositeSignature"`.

An authorization service is expected to know the Account and the Key that will be used to sign the transaction at the time the service is sent to FCL (during authentication).

```javascript
{
  f_type: "Service",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  type: "authz",               // say it's an authorization service
  uid: "amazing-wallet#authz", // standard service uid
  method: "HTTP/POST",         // can also be `IFRAME/RPC` or `POP/RPC`
  endpoint: "https://____",    // where to talk to the service
  identity: {
    f_type: "Identity",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    address: "0xUser",         // the address that the signature will be for
    keyId: 0,                  // the key for the address that the signature will be for
  },
  data: {},
  params: {},
}
```

FCL will use the `method` provided to request an array of composite signature from authorization service (Wrapped in a `PollingResponse`).
The authorization service will be sent a `Signable`.
The service is expected to construct an encoded message to sign from `Signable.voucher`.
It then needs to hash the encoded message, and prepend a required [transaction domain tag](../../../sdk/src/encode/encode.ts#L12-L13).
Finally it signs the payload with the user/s keys, producing a signature.
This signature, as a HEX string, is sent back to FCL as part of the `CompositeSignature` which includes the user address and keyID in the data property of a `PollingResponse`.

```elixir
signature =
  signable.voucher
    |> encode
    |> hash
    |> tag
    |> sign
    |> convert_to_hex
```

The eventual response back from the authorization service should resolve to something like this:
```javascript
{
  f_type: "PollingResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  status: "APPROVED",
  data: {
    f_type: "CompositeSignature",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    addr: "0xUSER",
    keyId: 0,
    signature: "signature as hex value"
  }
}
```

A `CompositeSignature` can alternatively be constructed using `WalletUtils`

```javascript
import {WalletUtils} from "@onflow/fcl"

WalletUtils.CompositeSignature(addr: String, keyId: Number, signature: Hex)

```

# User Signature Service

User Signature services are depicted with a `type: "user-signature"` and a `method` of either `HTTP/POST`, `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC`, `TAB/RPC` or `EXT/RPC`.
They are expected to eventually return an array of `f_type: "CompositeSignature"`.

The User Signature service is a stock/standard service.

```javascript
{
  f_type: "Service",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  type: "user-signature",               // say it's an user-signature service
  uid: "amazing-wallet#user-signature", // standard service uid
  method: "HTTP/POST",                  // can also be `IFRAME/RPC`
  endpoint: "https://___",              // where to talk to the service
  data: {},
  params: {},
}
```

FCL will use the `method` provided to request an array of composite signatures from the user signature service (Wrapped in a `PollingResponse`).
The user signature service will be sent a `Signable`.
The service is expected to tag the `Signable.message` and then sign it with enough keys to produce a full weight.
The signatures need to be sent back to FCL as HEX strings in an array of `CompositeSignatures`.

```javascript
// Pseudocode:
// For every required signature
import {WalletUtils} from "@onflow/fcl"

const encoded = WalletUtils.encodeMessageFromSignable(signable, signerAddress)
const taggedMessage = tagMessage(encoded) // Tag the message to sign
const signature = signMessage(taggedMessage) // Sign the message
const hexSignature = signatureToHex(signature) // Convert the signature to hex, if required.

return hexSignature
```

The eventual response back from the user signature service should resolve to something like this:
```javascript
{
  f_type: "PollingResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  status: "APPROVED",
  data: [
    {
      f_type: "CompositeSignature",
      f_vsn: "1.0.0",
      addr: "0xUSER",
      keyId: 0,
      signature: "signature as hex value"
    },
    {
      f_type: "CompositeSignature",
      f_vsn: "1.0.0",
      addr: "0xUSER",
      keyId: 1,
      signature: "signature as hex value"
    }
  ]
}
```

# Pre Authz Service

This is a strange one, but extremely powerful. This service should be used when a wallet is responsible for an account that's signing as multiple roles of a transaction, and wants the ability to change the accounts on a per role basis.

Pre Authz Services are depicted with a `type: "pre-authz"` and a `method` of either `HTTP/POST`, `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC`, `TAB/RPC` or `EXT/RPC`.
They are expected to eventually return a `f_type: "PreAuthzResponse"`.

The Pre Authz Service is a stock/standard service.

```javascript
{
  f_type: "Service",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  type: "pre-authz",               // say it's a pre-authz service
  uid: "amazing-wallet#pre-authz", // standard service uid
  method: "HTTP/POST",             // can also be IFRAME/RPC, POP/RPC, TAB/RPC
  endpoint: "https://___",         // where to talk to the service
  data: {},
  params: {},
}
```

FCL will use the `method` provided to request a `PreAuthzReponse` (Wrapped in a `PollingResponse`).
The Authorizations service will be sent a `PreSignable`.
The pre-authz service is expected to look at the `PreSignable` and determine the breakdown of accounts to be used.
The pre-authz service is expected to return `Authz` services for each role it is responsible for.
A pre-authz service can only supply roles it is responsible for.
If a pre-authz service is responsible for multiple roles, but it wants the same account to be responsible for all the roles, it will need to supply an Authz service per role.

The eventual response back from the pre-authz service should resolve to something like this:
```javascript
{
  f_type: "PollingResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  status: "APPROVED",
  data: {
    f_type: "PreAuthzResponse",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    proposer: {              // A single Authz Service
      f_type: "Service",
      f_vsn: "1.0.0",
      type: "authz",
      ...
    },
    payer: [                // An array of Authz Services
      {
        f_type: "Service",
        f_vsn: "1.0.0",
        type: "authz",
        ...
      }
    ],
    authorization: [       // An array of Authz Services (it's singular because it only represents a singular authorization)
      {
        f_type: "Service",
        f_vsn: "1.0.0",
        type: "authz",
        ...
      }
    ],
  }
}
```

# Authentication Refresh Service

Since synchronization of a user's session is important to provide a seamless user experience when using an app and transacting with the Flow Blockchain, a way to confirm, extend, and refresh a user session can be provided by the wallet.

Authentication Refresh Services should include a `type: "authn-refresh"`, `endpoint`, and supported `method` (`HTTP/POST`, `IFRAME/RPC`, `POP/RPC`, or `EXT/RPC`).

FCL will use the `endpoint` and service `method` provided to request updated authentication data.
The `authn-refresh` service should refresh the user's session if necessary and return updated authentication configuration and user session data.

The service is expected to return a `PollingResponse` with a new `AuthnResponse` as data. If user input is required, a `PENDING` `PollingResponse` can be returned with a `local` view for approval/re-submission of user details.

The Authentication Refresh Service is a stock/standard service.

```javascript
  {
    "f_type": "Service",
    "f_vsn": "1.0.0",
    "type": "authn-refresh",
    "uid": "uniqueDedupeKey",
    "endpoint": "https://rawr",
    "method": "HTTP/POST",  // "HTTP/POST", // HTTP/POST | IFRAME/RPC | HTTP/RPC
    "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", // wallet's internal id for the user
    "data": {}, // included in body of request
    "params": {}, // included as query params on endpoint url
  }
```

The provided `data` and `params` should include all the wallet needs to identify and re-authenticate the user if necessary.

The eventual response back from the `authn-refresh` service should resolve to an `AuthnResponse` and look something like this:

```javascript
{
  f_type: "PollingResponse",
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",
  status: "APPROVED",
  data: {
    f_type: "AuthnResponse",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0",
    addr: "0xUSER",
    services: [
      // Authentication Service - REQUIRED
      {
        f_type: "Service",
        f_vsn: "1.0.0",
        type: "authn",
        ...
      },
      // Authorization Service
      {
        f_type: "Service",
        f_vsn: "1.0.0",
        type: "authz",
        ...
      },
      // Authentication Refresh Service
      {
        f_type: "Service",
        f_vsn: "1.0.0",
        type: "authn-refresh",
        ...
      }
      // Additional Services
    ],
  }
}
```
