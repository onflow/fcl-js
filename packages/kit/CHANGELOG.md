## 0.0.1

Initial release of the FCL Kit Library. Built on top of FCL-JS, this library provides easy-to-use React bindings for building frontend applications that interact with Flow blockchain. It includes a set of components and hooks that simplify the process of connecting to Flow wallets, managing user sessions, querying on-chain data, and handling transactions.
