# @onflow/fcl-ethereum-provider

This package exposes a client-side [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compatible Ethereum provider that leverages an FCL-authenticated Cadence Owned Account (COA) under the hood. It enables wallets without native EVM capabilities to emulate Ethereum JSON-RPC by delegating signing and COA interactions to FCL.

For complete usage instructions, API details, and advanced configuration, please refer to the [official documentation](https://your-docs-url-here).

## Getting Started

Check out the [documentation](https://developers.flow.com/tools/clients/fcl-js/cross-vm/ethereum-provider) for guides and examples on how to integrate and use this provider in your project.
