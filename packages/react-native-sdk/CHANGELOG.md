## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2745](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-js/pull/2745) [`706e08247a1e13eb49f01671772e2172bf664338`](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-js/commit/706e08247a1e13eb49f01671772e2172bf664338) Thanks [@mfbz](https://github.com/mfbz)! - Added react-native-sdk package, similar to react-sdk but for react-native applications. It fully supports all the same hooks available in react-sdk, plus the connect and profile components. It leverages fcl-react-native for managing blockchain interactions and it's compatible to both react-native and expo applications.
