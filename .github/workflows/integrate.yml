      # This step is VERY important.  Changesets has a bug where peer dependencies will cause major version bumps
      # This script will prevent that from happening.  You must manually edit any changesets PRs which have this issue
      # to correct the version bump.
      #
      # If you wish to allow a major version bump, you will have to override this check, but be VERY careful with it.
