# Installation

This chapter explains the installation of the FCL JS library in your system. However, before moving to the installation, let us verify the prerequisite first.

## Prerequisite
- Node.js version v12.0.0 or higher. 

FCL JS depends on Node.js version v12.0.0 or higher. You can check your currently installed version using the below command:

```javascript
node --version
```

If Nodejs is not installed on your system, you can download and install it by visiting [Nodejs Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 


Install FCL JS using **npm** or **yarn**

```shell
npm i -S @onflow/fcl
```

```shell
yarn add @onflow/fcl
```
#### Importing

**ES6**
```js
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl";
```
**Node.js**
```js
const fcl = require("@onflow/fcl");
```
