## Discovery

Knowing all the wallets available to users on a blockchain can be challenging. FCL's Discovery mechanism relieves much of the burden of integrating with Flow compatible wallets and let's developers focus on building their dapp and providing as many options as possible to their users.

There are two ways an app can use Discovery: our **UI version** which can be configured for display via iFrame, Popup, and Tab, or the **API version** wwhich allows you to access authentication services directly in your code via `fcl.discovery.authn` method which we'll describe below.

## UI Version

When authenticating via FCL using Discovery UI, a user is shown a list of services they can use to login.

This method is the simplest way to integrate Discovery and its wallets and services into your app. All you have to do is configure `discovery.wallet` with the host endpoint for testnet or mainnet.

```javascript
import { config } from "@onflow/fcl";

config({
  "accessNode.api": "https://access-testnet.onflow.org", // Mainnet: "https://access-mainnet-beta.onflow.org"
  "discovery.wallet": "https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn" // Mainnet: "https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/authn"
})
```

Any time you call `fcl.authenticate` the user will be presented with that screen.

> ** NOTE: to change the view from iFrame to popup or tab set `discovery.wallet.method` to "POP/RPC" or "TAB/RPC". More info about service methods can be [found here](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-js/blob/9bce741d3b32fde18b07084b62ea15f9bbdb85bc/packages/fcl/src/wallet-provider-spec/draft-v3.md).

### Branding Discovery UI

Starting in version 0.0.79-alpha.4, dapps now have the ability to display app a title and app icon in the Discovery UI by setting a few values in their FCL app config. Branding is important because it adds an element of trust to your site by showing an app icon and title that a user is before going on to take an action in a wallet.

All you have to do is set `app.detail.icon` and `app.detail.title` like this:

```javascript
import { config } from "@onflow/fcl";

config({
  "app.detail.icon": "https://placekitten.com/g/200/200",
  "app.detail.title": "Kitten Dapp"
})
```

> ** NOTE: If these configuration options aren't set, Dapps using the Discovery API will still display a default icon and "Unknown App" title when attempting to authorize a user who is not logged in. **

## API Version

If you want more control over your authentication UI, the Discovery API is also simple to use as it exposes Discovery directly in your code via `fcl`.

Setup still requires configuration of the Discovery endpoint, but when using the API it is set via `discovery.authn.api` as shown below.

```javascript
import { config } from "@onflow/fcl"

config({
  "accessNode.api": "https://access-testnet.onflow.org", // Mainnet: "https://access-mainnet-beta.onflow.org"
  "discovery.authn.api": "https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/api/testnet/authn" // Mainnet: "https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/api/authn"
})
```

You can access services in your Dapp from `fcl.discovery`:

```javascript
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

fcl.discovery.authn.subscribe(callback)

// OR 

fcl.discovery.authn.snapshot()
```
In order to authenticate with a service (for example, when a user click's "login"), pass the selected service to the `fcl.authenticate` method described here [in the API reference](https://docs.onflow.org/fcl/reference/api/#authenticate):

```jsx
fcl.authenticate({ service })
```

A simple React component may end up looking like this:

```jsx
import "./config"
import { useState, useEffect } from "react"
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

function Component() {
  const [services, setServices] = useState([])
  useEffect(() => fcl.discovery.authn.subscribe(res => setServices(res.results)), [])

  return (
    <div>
      {services.map(service => <button key={service.id} onClick={() => fcl.authenticate({ service })}>Login with {service.provider.name}</button>)}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Helpful fields for your UI can be found in the `provider` object inside of the service. Fields include the following:

```
{
	...,
  "provider": {
    "address": "0xf086a545ce3c552d",
      "name": "Blocto",
      "icon": "/images/blocto.png",
      "description": "Your entrance to the blockchain world.",
      "color": "#afd8f7",
      "supportEmail": "support@blocto.app",
      "authn_endpoint": "https://flow-wallet-testnet.blocto.app/authn",
      "website": "https://blocto.portto.io"
    }
}
```
