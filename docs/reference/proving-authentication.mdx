## Proving Ownership of a Flow Account

A common desire that application developers have is to be able to prove that a
user controls an on-chain account. Proving ownership of an on-chain account is a
way to authenticate a user with an application backend. Fortunately,
FCL provides a way to achieve this.

During user authentication, some FCL compatible wallets will choose to support
the FCL `account-proof` service. If a wallet chooses to support this service, and
the user approves the signing of message data, they will return `account-proof` data
and a signature(s) that can be used to prove a user controls an on-chain account.

We'll walk through how you, an application developer, can use the `account-proof` service to
authenticate a user.

### Authenticating a user using `account-proof`

In order to authenticate your users via a wallet provider's account-proof service, your application needs to
configure FCL by setting `fcl.accountProof.resolver` and providing two pieces of information.

The `fcl.accountProof.resolver` is an async resolver function used by FCL to retrieve account proof data
from your application server. It can be set in your application configuration under the `fcl.accountProof.resolver`
key. The resolved data should include a specific application identifier (`appIdentifier`) and a random `nonce`.
This data will be sent to the wallet for signing by the user. If the user approves and authentication is successfull,
a signature is returned to the client in the data field of an `account-proof` service.

**Application Identifier**

An application identifier is a human-readable string that uniquely identifies your application name.
The identifier is displayed by wallets when users are asked to approve a signing request.
It helps users compare against the request origin and detect some malicious phishing attempts,
improving trust of the application and signing process.

**Random Nonce**

In addition to the `appIdentifier` your application must provide a **minimum 32-byte random nonce** as a hex string.

If for any reason your application backend does not want to request an `account-proof` during authentication,
it should send a response of `null`. If FCL receives a `null` response from the `accountProof.resolver` it will
continue the authentication process with the wallet but will not request an account-proof and no signature will be returned.

> In the case of a network or server error FCL will cancel the authentication process and return a rejected promise.

```js
import {config} from "@onflow/fcl"

type AccountProofData {
  // e.g. "Awesome App (v0.0)" - A human readable string to identify your application during signing
  appIdentifier: string;  

  // e.g. "75f8587e5bd5f9dcc9909d0dae1f0ac5814458b2ae129620502cb936fde7120a" - minimum 32-byte random nonce as hex string
  nonce: string;          
}

type AccountProofDataResolver = () => Promise<AccountProofData | null>;

config({
  "fcl.accountProof.resolver": accountProofDataResolver
})
```

Here is the suggested order of operations of how your application might use the
`account-proof` service:

- A user would like to authenticate via your application client using FCL. The process is triggered
  by a call to `fcl.authenticate()`. If `fcl.accountProof.resolver` is configured, FCL will attempt
  to retrieve the account proof data (`appIdentifier` and `nonce`) and trigger your server to start a new
  account proof authentication process.
- Your application server generates a **minimum 32-byte random nonce** using a local source of entropy and
  sends it to the client. The server saves the challenge for future look-ups.
- If FCL successfully retrieves the `account-proof` data, it continues the authentication process over a secure channel with the wallet.
  FCL includes the `appIdentifier` and `nonce` as part of the `FCL:VIEW:READY:RESPONSE` or HTTP POST request body.
  If the resolver function call fails to retrieve the nonce, FCL will cancel the authentication process.
- If the wallet supports account proofs and the user approves authentication with the wallet, the wallet will return the `account-proof`
  service with its response.

The data within the `account-proof` service will look like this:

```js
{
  f_type: "Service",                    // Its a service!
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",                       // Follows the v1.0.0 spec for the service
  type: "account-proof",                // The type of service it is
  method: "DATA",                       // Its data!
  uid: "awesome-wallet#account-proof",  // A unique identifier for the service
  data: {
    f_type: "account-proof",
    f_vsn: "2.0.0"

    // The user's address (8 bytes, i.e 16 hex characters)
    address: "0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7",                 

    // Nonce signed by the current account-proof (minimum 32 bytes in total, i.e 64 hex characters)
    nonce: "75f8587e5bd5f9dcc9909d0dae1f0ac5814458b2ae129620502cb936fde7120a",

    signatures: [CompositeSignature],
  }
}
```

- Your application client initiates a secure channel with your application server
  to relay the `account-proof` data and authenticate the user with your server.
  Subsequent exchanges between the client and server will happen over this channel.

- Your application server receives the `account-proof` data structure, and can then
  begin the verification process.

  - The server checks if the Flow address corresponds to an existing application
    account and determines whether it needs to sign in a returning user or create
    a new account. It is up to your application to decide how to manage
    the two cases.
  - The server looks the challenge up. If the nonce is not found or the nonce
    has expired, reject the authentication request, otherwise continue.
  - The server determines whether the `CompositeSignature` in the
    `account-proof` data structure contains valid signatures for the nonce
    and on-chain accounts (more details in the section below on how this is done).
  - If the verification is successful, delete the `nonce` or mark it as expired,
    the application account defined by the on-chain address is successfully
    logged in. Otherwise the authentication fails and the `nonce` is not deleted.

**Verification**

Your application can verify the signature against the data from `account-proof`
data using FCL's provided utility:

```js

import { AppUtils } from "@onflow/fcl"

  const accountProofData = {
    accountProof.address,   // address of the user authenticating
    accountProof.nonce,     // nonce
    accountProof.signatures // signatures
  }
  
  const isValid = await AppUtils.verifyAccountProof(
    appIdentifier,
    accountProofData
  )
```

## Implementation considerations:

- The authentication assumes the Flow address is the identifier of the user's application account.
  If an existing user doesn't have a Flow address in their profile, or if they decide to authenticate using
  a Flow address different than the one saved in their profile, the user's account won't be found and the
  process would consider a new user creating an account. It is useful for your application to consider
  other authentication methods that allow an existing user to update the Flow address in their profile so
  they are able to use FCL authentication.
- In the `account-proof` flow as described in this document,
  the backend doesn't know the user's account address at the moment of generating a nonce.
  This results in the nonces not being tied to particular Flow addresses. The backend should
  enforce an expiry window for each nonce to avoid the pool of valid nonces from growing indefinitely.
  Your application is encouraged to implement further mitigations against malicious attempts and
  maintain a scalable authentication process.
- FCL `account-proof` provides functionality to prove a user is in control of
  a Flow address. All other aspects of authentication, authorization and session management
  are up to the application. There are many resources available for setting up secure user
  authentication systems. Application developers should carefully consider what's best for their use
  case and follow industry best practices.
- It is important to use a secure source of entropy to generate the random nonces. The source should insure
  nonces are not predictable by looking at previously generated nonces. Moreover, backend should use its own
  local source and not rely on a publicly available source. Using a nonce of at least 32-bytes insures
  it is extremely unlikely to have a nonce collision.
- Your application identifier `appIdentifier` is a constant defined by your backend. It is
  important that the backend uses the `appIdentifier` it expects when verifying the signatures,
  and not rely on an identifier passed along with the `account-proof`. For this reason,
  `appIdentifier` is not included in the `account-proof` data.
- A successful FCL authentication proves the user fully controls a Flow account. This means the user
  controls one or many account keys with weights that add up to the full account weight. The authentication
  would fail if the user doesn't control keys that add up to a full weight.
