## Proving Ownership of a Flow Account

A common desire that application developers have is to be able to prove that a
user controls an on chain account. Fortunately, FCL provides multiple ways to
achieve this.

During user authentication, some FCL compatible wallets will choose to support
the FCL `account-proof` service. If a wallet chooses to support this service,
they will include within it specific pieces of information that you can use to
prove that a user controls an on chain account. The service, and its data within
it, will be returned from the wallet during authentication, and made available
for your use in `FCL Current User`. 

If a user's wallet does not choose to support the `account-proof` service, you
can still prove that a user controls an on chain account provided that the
wallet does support the `user-signature` service. Since all wallets may
optionally choose to support either of these services, your application should
be resilient enough to handle cases where a user's wallet supports one, both or
neither.

The `account-proof` service, as the name implies, was designed specifically for
proving authentication, while `user-signature` was designed for more generic use
cases. We suggest that your application choose to use `account-proof` service
first, if it's available, and then fall back to `user-signature` if needed.

We'll walk through how you, an application developer, can use either service to
prove a user's authentication.

### Proving User Authentication using `account-proof`

The suggested order of operations of how your application might use
`account-proof` begins with:

- Optional: Your application may choose to configure FCL with an application
  specific Domain Tag. A Domain Tag helps scope the cryptographic proof
  generated for the `account-proof` service to your application. A Domain Tag is
  a valid string less than 32 bytes long. Your application can configure a
  Domain Tag like:

```javascript
import {config} from "@onflow/fcl"

config({
    "fcl.appDomainTag": "YourApplicationsDomainTag"
})
```

- Your application calls `fcl.authenticate()` to begin the user authentication
  process.
- Your user's wallet will optionally return the `account-proof` service as part
  of authentication.
- Your application extracts the data within the `account-proof` service.

The data within the `account-proof` service will look like:

```javascript
{
  f_type: "Service",  // Its a service!
  f_vsn: "1.0.0",  // Follows the v1.0.0 spec for the service
  type: "account-proof",  // the type of service it is
  method: "DATA",  // Its data!
  uid: "amazing-wallet#account-proof",  // A unique identifier for the service            
  data: {
    f_type: "account-proof",
    f_vsn: "1.0.0"
    signatures: [CompositeSignature],
    address: "0xUSER",  // The user's address
    timestamp: 1630705495551, // UNIX timestamp
    domainTag: "AWESOME_DAPP", // Optional
  }         
}
```

- Your application will send the `account-proof` service data structure to it's
  backend over a secure channel.

Once your application receives the `account-proof` data structure, it can then
begin to use it to prove user authentication. The steps that your application's
backend must follow in using this data are specific.

- First your application must determine wether a user with the `address`
  provided in the `account-proof` data structure has authenticated with your
  application before.
    - If a user with the `address` has authenticated with your application
      before, then your system must query the `timestamp` associated with the
      previous authentication for this user.
        - If the `timestamp` is less than or equal to the `timestamp` associated
          with the users previous authentication, your system must abort and
          reject the authentication attempt.
        - If the `timestamp` is greater than the `timestamp` associated with the
          users previous authentication, then continue.
        - Ensure the `timestamp` is reasonable. (e.g: Not a `timestamp`
          associated with a time far in the future, or far in the past)
    - If a user with the `address` _has not_ authenticated with your application
      before, then continue.

- Your application must determine whether the `CompositeSignature` in the
  `account-proof` data structure contains a valid signature. Your application
  will do this by:
    - Using FCL's provided utility for reconstructing the data that was signed
    to produce the `CompositeSignature`:

      ```javascript 
      import {WalletUtils} from "@onflow/fcl"

      const Address = AccountProof.address 
      const Timestamp = AccountProof.timestamp

      const Message = WalletUtils.encodeMessageForProvableAuthnVerifying(
        Address,              // Address of the user authenticating
        Timestamp,            // Timestamp associated with the authentication
        "Awesome-Dapp"        // Application domain tag  
      )
      ```

    - Alternatively you can manually reconstruct the data that was signed to produce the
      `CompositeSignature`. Pseudocode:

      ```javascript
      import rlp from "@onflow/rlp"

      const Address = AccountProof.address
      const Timestamp = AccountProof.timestamp

      const rightPaddedHexBuffer = (value, pad) =>
        Buffer.from(value.padEnd(pad * 2, 0), "hex")

      const YourApplicationsDomainTag = "Awesome-Dapp"
      const DomainTag = 
        rightPaddedHexBuffer(
            Buffer.from(YourApplicationsDomainTag).toString("hex"), 
            32
        ).toString("hex")

      const Message = DomainTag + rlp([ 
        Address,
        Timestamp
      ])
      ```

  - Verify that the `account-proof` signature is valid for the reconstructed
    data. Your application can do this through executing it's own Cadence
    script, or using `fcl.verifyUserSignature`:

```javascript
...
const isValid = await fcl.verifyUserSignature(
    Message,
    AccountProof.signatures
)
```

- If the signature has been proven valid, your application has then successfully
  proved that the user does control the account with address they authenticated
  with.
- Your application must finally save the `AccountProof.timestamp` associated
  with this authentication attempt alongside the `address` for the user for
  future reference.

### Proving User Authentication using `user-signature`

If your user's wallet does not return the the FCL `account-proof` service, your
application can still prove user authentication using the `user-signature`
service, as long as it is supported by your user's wallet.

Your application's backend must first generate a random message for the user to
sign with their wallet, using the `user-signature` service. Your application
should retain this random message and associate it with the `address` of the
account the user is authenticating with for future reference.

Your application will then pass this message to it's frontend, where it will
call:

```javascript
const CompositeSignatures = await fcl.currentUser().signUserMessage(Message)
```

Once the user's wallet has signed the message, your application will then verify
that the signature is correct. It will do this by passing the
`CompositeSignatures` to your applications backend. Your application will then
execute it's own Cadence script, or otherwise use `fcl.verifyUserSignature`:

```javascript
const isValid = await fcl.verifyUserSignature(
    Message,
    CompositeSignatures
)
```

If the signature has been proved valid, your application has then successfully
proved that the user does control the account with address they authenticated
with.
