title: Flow JavaScript SDK

## Introducing `@onflow/fcl`

Flow's JavaScript SDK was created to make developing JavaScript applications that connect to
the Flow blockchain easy and secure.

While it would be possible to create a Flow wallet as a browser plugin, we specifically created `@onflow/fcl` so that web-based dapps donâ€™t have to depend on browser
plugins. `@onflow/fcl` is able to connect browser-based dapps to a wallet service, or a wallet installed on your phone
or running on your local computer without introducing the security risks that can come from installing
a browser plugin.

## Wallet Discovery

`@onflow/fcl` also eliminates the need for dapp developers to write code to integrate their user's preferred wallet into
their application. Instead,`@onflow/fcl` uses a secure discovery protocol that wallets can implement to connect
to `@onflow/fcl`. The end result is dapps using `@onflow/fcl` automatically integrate all compatible wallets without their developers
needing to write any custom code!

## Limitless Development

`@onflow/fcl` enables cross-platform dapps. By not depending on JavaScript injection as a mechanism for connecting dapps with wallets,
native desktop dapps and mobile dapps can connect to the same wallet software as browser dapps.

## Getting Started with FCL

To use the Flow JavaScript SDK in your application, install using **yarn** or **npm**

```shell
npm i -S @onflow/fcl @onflow/types

```
